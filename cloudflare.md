# Piwik

Piwik is the leading open source web analytics platform that gives you valuable 
insights into your website's visitors, your marketing campaigns and much more, so 
you can optimize your strategy and online experience of your visitors.

CloudFlare Integration for Piwik installed on all your pages, even error
pages, with high-performance asynchronous code loading.

## Installing Piwik

You must have Piwik installed already to use this app. It does not install or run
Piwik by itself, but merely inserts the Piwik tracking code in all your pages. The
tracking code then communicates with your Piwik installation.

For information about installing and running Piwik, [visit the piwik.org website](//piwik.org).

## Limitations

The app currently does not fully support all tracking code features available in Piwik.
If it's missing a feature you need, feel free to let us know by creating 
[an issue on the GitHub tracker](//github.com/BitolaCo/piwik_cfapp/issues).

## Support

If you need support, feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](//github.com/BitolaCo/piwik_cfapp/issues),
